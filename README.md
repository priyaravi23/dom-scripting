### CSS Holy Grail Layout
- Sidebars and main content should have the same height, regardless of which element is the tallest,
- Sidebars should have fixed width and main content fluid width,
- The center column (main content) should appear first in the HTML source,
- If the content is sparse, the footer should stay to the bottom of the page,
- The layout should be responsive, all the sections should collapse into one column on smaller viewports
