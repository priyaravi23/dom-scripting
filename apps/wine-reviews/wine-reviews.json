The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go.","taster_name":"Michael Schachner","taster_twitter_handle":"@wineschach","price":20,"designation":"Reserve Las Barrancas Vineyards","variety":"Cabernet Sauvignon","region_1":"Mendoza","region_2":null,"province":"Mendoza Province","country":"Argentina","winery":"Pascual Toso"},{"points":"88","title":"Quinta de la Rosa 2004 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)","description":"This is a sweet, rich Port. Its aromas are of soft berry jelly, with a ripe herbal character. To taste, it is concentrated, but the sweetness of the fruit masks its density.

It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors. The finish is wide and rich, but where are the tannins and structure that this wine is known for? Drink now for best results; it may not improve in the cellar.
